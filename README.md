Urban Planner Pro: Advanced GIS & AI Toolkit for Planners and City Officials

Overview:
Develop a comprehensive web platform for urban planners and city officials, featuring two distinct, seamless modules:
1. Municipal Financial Health & GIS Dashboard

    GIS Web Interface:
    Display all US municipalities on an interactive map (Leaflet JS), integrating financial and demographic data extracted from municipalities’ ACFRs (already in Postgres tables: municipalities and financial data with 30+ metrics).

    Key Data Visualizations:

        Revenue, assets, capital assets, depreciation, workforce size, demographics, bonds, capital assets by type, operating indicators, etc.

        Interactive, customizable charts (Apache ECharts) for single or comparative municipalities.

        Nationwide map view: municipalities are color-coded by a selected or custom-calculated datapoint (e.g., revenue/acreage).

    Advanced Search & Filters:

        Search bar for municipality selection.

        Custom calculations and filters for cross-county/region comparisons or insights.

    Parcel Data Uploads:
    Allow users to upload parcel shapefiles for a municipality, triggering advanced calculations (through Geopandas server-side) to identify fiscally productive versus underperforming areas.

        UI placeholder for parcel analytics, to be enabled in future phases.

    Chart & Map Download:

        Download option (PNG or SVG) for any chart or selected map frame.

    Financial Chart Defaults for Selected Municipality:

        Total assets/liabilities

        Net financial position (current assets - total liabilities)

        Financial assets-to-liabilities (current assets/total liabilities)

        Net debt to total revenues ((net financial position * -1) / total revenues)

        Interest/total revenues

        Net book capital assets/total capital assets

        Government transfer/total revenues ((Operating Grants + Capital Grants)/Revenue)

        Custom chart options for user-created metrics.

    Subscription Model:

        Access to financial data requires subscription, with a free 1-month trial (integrate Stripe for payments).

        User authentication and permissions via Django Ninja’s built-in auth.

2. Urban Design AI Tools

    Cross-Section Image Generator:

        Left: Live preview of generated cross-section images (DALL-E 3, using LLM-powered prompts).

        Right: Drag & drop interface for defining cross-section panels:

            Input width, height, material, use for each panel.

            Reorder panels (top-to-bottom = left-to-right on image).

            Choose from curated design themes.

            Submit to generate an image; download option available (PNG).

        UI placeholder for “Bird’s Eye” generator, mimicking tools like UrbanistAI, to support future expansion.

    User Credits & Tiers:

        Image generation requires credits or a specialized subscription tier; include Stripe billing integration.

        Button to save generated images to user profile.

    Responsive Interface:
    Easy-to-use for both desktop and tablet.

3. User Dashboard

    Navigation:
    Top navbar with “Finance View”, “Designer View”, and “Profile”.

    Profile Pages:

        Security settings

        Payments & subscriptions (Stripe integration for upgrades, add-on credits)

        Gallery of last 10 generated images and user-saved images

4. Technical Stack

    Backend:
    Django Ninja (Python) for modular monolithic architecture. Geopandas for server-side GIS. PostgreSQL+PostGIS for all data storage, ready to scale.

    Frontend:
    React.js + TailwindCSS (for a modern, maintainable UI), Leaflet for maps, Apache ECharts for charts.

    AI Integration:
    DALL-E 3 for image generation, pluggable via API from server.

    Auth & Billing:
    Django Ninja auth, Stripe for payments.

    Deployment & Ops:
    Docker for containerization and reproducibility.

5. UI/UX and Visual Design

    Style inspiration:
    Reference reventure.app, Zillow, and Redfin for layout and design clarity.

    Color palette:

        #353535 (Deep charcoal)

        #3c6e71 (Teal)

        #ffffff (White)

        #d9d9d9 (Light gray)

        #284b63 (Slate blue)

        #ee6c4d (Urban orange-accent)

    Strong emphasis on modern, clean layouts with intuitive navigation and subtle transitions.

Additional Guidance

    Prioritize code modularity for all server and client components.

    Implement placeholder UIs for advanced/premium features (e.g., parcel analytics, bird’s eye generator) to illustrate roadmap.

    All interactive and downloadable chart/map/image features should be clearly accessible.

    Focus on accessibility and device compatibility from Day 1.

Goal:
Deliver a platform that empowers municipalities and planners to visualize, compare, and improve fiscal and spatial health, and to generate AI-powered urban design solutions—built for scale, clarity, and extensibility...
